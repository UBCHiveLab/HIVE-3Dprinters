Taz 6 is the first printer we have. We have both dual and single head extruder. There's a bunch of info about the printer in each printer's folder.

TOPRINT (before jan2020):
- 3 pelvis with img targets
- 12 L and R ears
- 1 circle of willis (post cerebral art no problemo)
- 20 brainz

TODO:
- get stella's documentation and add to it
- buy new pei bed sheet and replace current sheet
- nylon single profile
- wood hips profile
- pla profile
- try pva again
- take out the trash
- get fitted for mask
- maybe prepare a new space for sla printer (talk to claudia)
