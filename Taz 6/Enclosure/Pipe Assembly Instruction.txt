1. Buy all materials as instructed in BOM
2. Take a look at assembly outline image, so you have an idea of what you're building
3. Cut the pipe as follows
Pipes (all lengths in mm):
A = 225, x1
B = 460, x2
C = 800, x2
D = 350, x2
E = 510, x4
(ex: one of 225mm pipe, two of 460mm pipes, etc.)
4. Print the parts in joints as follows
Joints:
1, x2
2, x2
3, x4
4, x2
(ex: two of 1.stl, two of 2.stl, etc)
5. Mix the epoxy and glue the joints to the pipes according to assembly outline to make the enclosure frame
The only part that shouldn't be glued is the C-pipe to the 2-joint, since that is supposed to slide along the C-pipe
Don't worry if the pipe is loose on the joint; I dimensioned the hole a bit big to accomodate for different printers' tolerances, so just use extra epoxy
If you want to connect two pipes together, use pipe connector in joints folder
6. When all epoxy is cured, wrap plastic sheet around the frame
Tape plastic sheet where neccessary, or poke small holes and use zipties
